For your health! 

We want to design an android mobile app that allows the user to create a profile that specifies 
their age, weight, life style choices, allergies... etc. in order to create a nutrition plan and 
workout schedule. After the User generates a premade nutrition plan and workout schedule. The user 
would then be able to look through the plans and remove and add things they would like to and from 
the plans. After the user confirms their plan, they will be taken to their “Day” page. The User will 
never access the create profile pages again, but they will still have the opportunity to change their 
plans and goals and profile information. They will have four fragments to look through. “Day”, “Week”, 
“Progress”, and “Preferences” Day will display their daily Workout and meal plan, “Week” will d
isplay their weekly plans, and “Progress” will display the user’s progress towards their defined goals. 
“Preferences” will allow them to change their plans and goals.
